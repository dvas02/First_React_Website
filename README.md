# First_React_Website
My first react website, just to get used to how it works and how to use JSX.

To run this website create a react project and simply replace all the files with the ones here, 
except you need to keep the node_modules which I did not include because it is a huge package and 
not code that I made.

The website itself was to familiarize myself with JSX but also how to use basic CSS and convert CSS into JSX. As well as the use of modular programming and creating components.
